# Responses to DOE RFI on Stewardship of Software for Scientific and High-Performance Computing

I threw together this repository because I think there's a lot of interesting work going
on around software sustainability in DOE, but it's not particularly visible. In October
2021, DOE put out an RFI on
[*Stewardship of Software for Scientific and High-Performance Computing*](https://github.com/tgamblin/ascr-software-stewardship-rfi-responses/raw/main/rfi-2021-23582.pdf)
(also [here](rfi-2021-23582.pdf)). The responses were posted, but not in an accessible
way. This repo contains all the responses to DOE RFI 2021-203582, listed by institution,
so that more people can read them.

Everything here is already available from various DOE web sites, but it's sometimes hard
to put it all together. This stuff is important to me, because I care a lot about
scientific software sustainability. There's actually a *lot* of work around scientific
software development that goes on at the national labs. If this is something you're
interested in, I encourage you to read on.

## What's an RFI?

An RFI is a (usually public) *request for input*. Labs and other organizations (usually
ones who want to steer the direction of public funding) respond. The responses are
public. In this case, they're read by funding agencies to help set priorities and
funding requests.

## What motivated this?

The U.S. [Exascale Computing Project](http://exascaleproject.org) (ECP), which ends in
2023, has been working to harden the software stack in preparation for the U.S.'s first
[exascale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exascale_computing) supercomputers. ECP is a
joint effort of
[ASCR](https://www.energy.gov/science/ascr/advanced-scientific-computing-research) and
[NNSA](https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/national-nuclear-security-administration) labs --
basically the two parts of DOE that fund most of the nation's large-scale high
performance computing.

ECP's progress was reviewed by [ASCAC](https://science.osti.gov/ascr/ascac), and they
wrote
[a report](https://science.osti.gov/-/media/ascr/ascac/pdf/meetings/202004/Transition_Report_202004-ASCAC.pdf)(also
[here](Transition_Report_202004-ASCAC.pdf)) on how some of the ECP funding should be
transitioned when ECP ends in 2023. The report said:

> We recommend that ASCR build a shared software stewardship program to leverage and
> build on the ECP developed ecosystem to develop, curate, harden, and distribute
> software essential for effective use of HPC systems.

In response to that, this RFI is asking for:

> information on critical software dependencies, development- practice requirements, and
> other factors relevant to the development of a software stewardship model suitable for
> sustaining the software ecosystem for scientific and high-performance computing.

In the RFI, you can see that there are more specific questions around dependencies,
training, workforce support, infrastructure, packaging, curation, outreach, shared
engineering resources, and project support. Basically, all the things you'd need to
create a software sustainability program.

## Responses

The RFI responses are available
[on regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOE-HQ-2021-0027-0001/comment),
but it's really hard to see who wrote each response. To make this stuff easier to
browse, I've put together links to all the responses below. A lot of thought went into
some of these, so if you want a window into what different labs, code projects, and
other organizations are thinking about software sustainability, this is a good place to
start. I hope these give people a better window into sustainability (or, at least,
sustainability plans) in DOE.
